# VaccumCleaner
Industrial Vacuum Cleaner:
Industrial Vacuum Cleaner project based on ARM-CortexM4 processor developed in C-Language. Debugged and simulated using Keil-IDE (v5) ... the project is part of Swift Act Training (Embedded Software Design).
Details
The Project presents the software development of an industrial vacuum cleaner that has 3 necessary speed states: (Low Speed - Medium Speed - Max Speed) And the vacuum's motor speed is to be changed using a switch (speed can be changed multiple times using the switch till it reaches the maximum or minimum speed). Additionally, the current speed will be displayed.

Note that the speed will be in degrees ... and the speed states angles will correspond to the AC sine wave targeted angle (obtained by TRIAC) but it's simulated using SysTick for simulation purpose.

Generally, the vacuum will have 3 fundamental states:
1. Firing State: which will be the triggering pulse that the changes firing angle corresponding to each complete sine wave (cycle)

2. Soft Switching State: used when changing from one speed to another

3. Harmonic Reduction State: used when the desired speed is obtained ... by using Kurz Technique the motor will continuously operate at the same speed suppressing the effect of the harmonics.

Note that the firing angle is the angle that gets continuously updated based on the target vacuum cleaner state angle (Soft Switching State or Harmonic Reduction State).

illustrating the vacuum cleaner operation ... the toolbox menu simulates the switches where,

Plus: increases speed by 50 degrees
Minus: Decreases speed by 50 degrees
Dust: Resets speed to remove dust and restores operation when pressed again.

The following image clarifies the Vacuum Cleanerâ€™s (VC) states upon increasing and decreasing speed knowing that the maximum speed --> 10 degrees ... minimum speed --> 140 degrees.
